# Composable Security

## Our story

We've already helped dozens of projects keep their products and systems secure, but we believe we can do even more.
 
Participation in conferences such as ETHcc or ETHWarsaw and numerous interactions with the community convinced us that blockchain-based projects are the future. It is not just about technology, itâ€™s about the people who create it. Seeing how committed, open-minded and willing to educate web3 developers are, we decided to go full time and do everything we can to help them build a better, more efficient and more transparent world.
 
The Composable Security company was founded in August 2022 by Damian Rusinek ([@drdr_zz](https://twitter.com/drdr_zz)) and PaweÅ‚ KuryÅ‚owicz ([@wh01s7](https://twitter.com/wh01s7)) who have actively contributed to the crypto space since 2017. 
 
Starting from the creation of the Smart Contract Security Verification Standard, through numerous audits of smart contracts, to the introduction of threat modeling to DeFi. Through numerous publications, presentations, and a series of educational tweets, we tried to share the best security practices developed thanks to many years of experience in web2.
 
Security should be adapted to each stage of development, security should be **composable** to the best suits visionary needs.
 
Thatâ€™s why we started **Composable Security**.
